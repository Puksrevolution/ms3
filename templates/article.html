                    As I live alone, I have never been one to stock up on items like produce.
                    If I bought too much, it'd go bad before I got to use it.
                    But with tightening budgets and the desire to avoid too many grocery store trips,
                    it has become essential in recent months to buy more at a time.

                <p class="pb-2">
                    Buying a bag of onions or apples rather than one here and there undeniably saves in costs,
                    but another problem entirely can arise: Those onions or apples,
                    after they sit out for a while, may start to turn, and they will most certainly let out a
                    siren call for pests like fruit flies.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-2">
                    Who among us hasn't walked into our kitchen and felt our hearts drop as those tiny flies
                    circulate? For better or worse, fruit flies can happen to all of us — even those fastidious
                    about using produce quickly in order to avoid the pests.

                <p class="pb-3">
                    If and when your home is invaded, it's time to act to get rid of the fruit flies.
                    Quick action at the first sight of fruit flies can curb the problem before an infestation
                    gets out of control. We asked experts to share how to get rid of fruit flies,
                    and we're revealing their DIY tips below.

                <h3 class="text-center pt-5"><strong>1. Identify the Fly</strong></h3>
                <p class="py-2">
                    Part of the problem with fruit flies is that they look a lot like other types of flies,
                    and how you get rid of each does depend on what they are.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-2">
                    "It's important to confirm whether or not you are in fact dealing with fruit flies,
                    because treatment for getting rid of them differs from something like fungus gnats or
                    drain flies," says Wesley Wheeler, owner of
                    <a href="https://buglord.com/">
                        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-danger"><u>Bug Lord</u></span>
                    </a>.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-2">
                    So how do you tell the difference? Drain flies look like tiny black moths and can often be
                    confused with fruit flies because both lay eggs in drains. "They have fluffy dark wings that
                    are round and held flat on top of the body, and their antennae are fluffy and feathery like
                    moth antennae," Wheeler says. In fact, another name for drain flies is moth flies.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-3">
                    "Fungus gnats are roughly one-eighth inch in size and have a similar resemblance to mosquitoes
                    — just smaller," Wheeler says. They have long legs and a lackluster flying ability, so you may
                    see them stumbling around and spending more time scurrying along house plants and windows.
                    Fruit flies on the other hand, Wheeler adds, are very quick and elusive, and are usually found
                    in kitchens where there is ripening fruit and garbage. They can quickly be identified by their
                    characteristically large red eyes.

                <h3 class="text-center pt-5"><strong>2. Use Deterring Scents </strong></h3>
                <p class="py-2">
                    Fruit flies hate several rather nice smelling natural scents, including peppermint, lavender,
                    eucalyptus, lemongrass, and clove. "You can hang dried herbs in paper tea bags or muslin sacks
                    around the house, or add essential oils of these plants into a diffuser," says Nicholas Martin,
                    founder and editor-in-chief of
                    <a href="https://pestcontrolhacks.com/">
                        <span class="badge rounded-pill bg-danger"><u>Pest Control Hacks</u></span>
                    </a>. A fun added bonus is that your home will smell
                    really pleasant after doing this.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center pt-5"><strong>3. Change Dishcloths and Sponges Regularly</strong></h3>
                <p class="py-2">
                    Sponges may be essential kitchen items for keeping things clean and tidy, but the reality is
                    they are magnets for food leftovers. "They are accumulated inside even if you don't see them,"
                    Martin says. And you know what? Fruit flies breed on them. Replace these items weekly to
                    prevent that.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center pt-5"><strong>4. Keep the Kitchen Clean</strong></h3>
                <p class="py-2">
                    That means taking care of crumbs, tiny cooking leftovers, dust, stains, dishes.
                    "All these are highly attractive to fruit flies and many other insects, so keeping your
                    kitchen sparkling clean is an essential step," Martin says.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center pt-5"><strong>5. Toss the Rot</strong></h3>
                <p class="py-2">
                    If those bananas or onions are starting to look iffy, it's time to toss them before they
                    become a breeding ground for pests. "Promptly discard any rotting food, as this is where
                    fruit flies lay eggs — which can be up to 500 at a time," Wheeler says. That means you should
                    also immediately take that garbage that's filled with rotting fruits and veggies outside
                    and tie it up, too, instead of simply tossing it in your kitchen trash can.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center pt-5"><strong>6. Cover Fruit Bowls</strong></h3>
                <p class="py-2">
                    Fruit flies are extremely sensitive and can sense when there's fruit and vegetables they can
                    get to. They can even do this from afar, according to Martin. That's why covering them with a
                    cake dome, cloth, or plastic wrap is a good plan.
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-center pt-5"><strong>7. Use a Fruit/Vegetable Wash</strong></h3>
                <p class="py-2">
                    Believe it or not, fruit flies can travel to your home right on the produce you get from the store.
                    "Leaving unwashed produce on the counter, you just let the flies feast and breed nonstop," Martin
                    says. To prevent that, you can simply wash new produce with a

                    </a> and water before putting them in their bowl or containers for sage keeping.

                <p class="py-2">
                    A fruit fly trap can get the problem under control pretty quickly.
                    Many store-bought traps perform really well, says Wheeler, pointing to the
                    <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRO-Fruit-Fly-Trap-T2502/dp/B01JIRNEQW?&linkCode=ll1&tag=artrickstoriddingyourhomeoffruitfliesthissummerawalansky0721-20&linkId=7ee3386faec47f02dc884ec980e8a3a1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">

                    specifically. It's simply a sweet liquid that attracts the flies into a container from which they
                    are unable to escape.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-2">
                    You can also make your own fruit fly trap though. It's not difficult to make your own fruit fly
                    trap, and it can be a little cheaper and more satisfying than buying a commercial trap.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-2">
                    "The best way to make your very own fruit fly trap is to use a small jar like a mason jar, and put
                    about a cup of apple cider vinegar into it," Wheeler says. Then add a few drops of dish soap. That
                    is all there is to it.
                </p>
                <p class="pb-3">
                    "You can also add a funnel to the top of the jar which makes it easy for flies to enter, but very
                    difficult to leave before touching the liquid," Wheeler says.

                <p class="py-2">
                    Brace yourselves: Ultimately, there's no way of knowing how many fruit flies and eggs are inside
                    your drains. Flushing out those drains can get things under control.

                    To do this, just use a commercially available fruit fly drain cleaner. Treat it like Draino, and
                    pour it right down the sink, following the directions on the packaging.

                    is one example of a gel-based drain cleaner for fruit flies. It's created from natural citronella
                    oil, so it won't hurt you or your pipes, but it will kill the flies hiding there," Wheeler says.
